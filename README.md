# R-Nepal-training-2024

This R project combines corrected versions of the scripts prepared for the R training workshop: Build capacities of FRTC on National Forest
Inventory and Carbon accounting data analysis with R.

The scripts are grouped in 3 folders covering the following training sessions:

1. R-play: three scripts to play with the NFI tree data, generate tree location maps and introduce spatial data analysis with raster extraction (session 03 - Intermediate R with NFI tree data).

1. R-NFI: series of R scripts sourced from 'main-analysis.R' that recalculate tree AGB and aggregate to plot, cluster and LEAF forest classes AGB (session 04 - AGB calculations from tree to LEAF classes).

1. R-CA: series of R scripts sourced from 'main-carbon-accounting.R' that recalculate activity data, emission factors, emissions and FREL from the LEAF Call for Proposal, currently performed with MS Excel tools (session 05 - Carbon Accounting).


### Warning 

The scripts depends on source data that were provided during the workshop and are not synced with git and Github (see .gitignore).
